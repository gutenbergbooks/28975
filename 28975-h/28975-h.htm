<h2>THE MORAL PIRATES.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">BY Wm. L. ALDEN</span>.</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter I</span>.</h3>

<p>"The truth is, John," said Mr. Wilson to his brother, "I am troubled
about my boy. Here it is the first of July, and he can't go back to
school until the middle of September. He will be idle all that time, and
I'm afraid he'll get into mischief. Now the other day I found him
reading a wretched story about pirates. Why should a son of mine care to
read about pirates?"</p>

<p>"Because he's a boy. All boys like piratical stories. I know, when I was
a boy, I thought that if I could be either a pirate or a stage-driver I
should be perfectly happy. Of course you don't want Harry to read
rubbish; but it doesn't follow, because a boy reads stories about
piracy, that he wants to commit murder and robbery. I didn't want to
kill anybody: I wanted to be a moral and benevolent pirate. But here
comes Harry across the lawn. What will you give me if I will find
something for him to do this summer that will make him forget all about
piracy?"</p>

<p>"I only wish you would. Tell me what your plan is."</p>

<p>"Come here a minute, Harry," said Uncle John. "Now own up: do you like
books about pirates?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, uncle, I do."</p>

<p>"So did I when I was your age. I thought it would be the best fun in the
world to be a Red Revenger of the Seas."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span></p><p>"Wouldn't it, though!" exclaimed Harry. "I don't mean it would be fun
to kill people, and to steal watches, but to have a schooner of your
own, and go cruising everywhere, and have storms and&mdash;and&mdash;hurricanes,
you know."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't you do it this summer?" asked Uncle John. "If you want to
cruise in a craft of your own, you shall do it; that is, if your father
doesn't object. A schooner would be a little too big for a boy of
thirteen, but you and two or three other fellows might make a splendid
cruise in a row-boat. You could have a mast and sail, and you could take
provisions and things, and cruise from Harlem all the way up into the
lakes in the Northern woods. It would be all the same as piracy, except
that you would not be committing crimes, and making innocent people
wretched."</p>

<p>"Uncle John, it would be just gorgeous! We'd have a gun, and a lot of
fishing-lines, and we could live on fish and bears. There's bears in the
woods, you know."</p>

<p>"You won't find many bears, I'm afraid; but you would have to take a
gun, and you might possibly find a wild-cat or two. Who is there that
would go with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there's Tom Schuyler, and Joe and Jim Sharpe; and there's Sam
McGrath&mdash;though he'd be quarrelling all the time. Maybe Charley Smith's
father would let him go. He is a first-rate fellow. You'd ought to see
him play base-ball once!"</p>

<p>"Three boys besides yourself would be enough. If you have too many,
there will be too much risk of quarrelling. There is one thing you must
be sure of&mdash;no boy must go who can't swim."</p>

<p>"Oh, all the fellows can swim, except Bill Town. He was pretty near
drowned last summer. He'd been bragging about what a stunning swimmer he
was, and the boys believed him; so one day one of the fellows shoved him
off the float, where we go in swimming at our school, and he thought he
was dead for sure. The water was only up to his neck, but he couldn't
swim a stroke."</p>

<p>"Well, if you can get three good fellows to go with you&mdash;boys that you
know are not young scamps, but are the kind of boys that your father
would be willing to have you associate with&mdash;I'll give you a boat and a
tent, and you shall have a better cruise than any pirate ever had; for
no real pirate ever found any fun in being a thief and a murderer. You
go and see Tom and the Sharpe boys, and tell them about it. I'll see
about the boat as soon as you have chosen your crew."</p>

<p>"You are quite sure that your plan is a good one?" asked Mr. Wilson, as
the boy vanished, with sparkling eyes, to search for his comrades.
"Isn't it very risky to let the boys go off by themselves in a boat?
Won't they get drowned?"</p>

<p>"There is always more or less danger in boating," replied Uncle John;
"but the boys can swim; and they can not learn prudence and
self-reliance without running some risks. Yes, it is a good plan, I am
sure. It will give them plenty of exercise in the open air, and will
teach them to like manly, honest sports. You see that the reason Harry
likes piratical stories is his natural love of adventure. I venture to
predict that if their cruise turns out well, those four boys will think
stories of pirates are stupid as well as silly."</p>

<p>So the matter was decided. Harry found that Tom Schuyler and the Sharpe
boys were delighted with the plan, and Uncle John soon obtained the
consent of Mr. Schuyler and Mr. Sharpe. The boys immediately began to
make preparations for the cruise; and Uncle John bought a row-boat, and
employed a boat-builder to make such alterations as were necessary to
fit it for service.</p>

<p>The boat was what is called a Whitehall row-boat. She was seventeen feet
long, and rowed very easily, and she carried a small mast with a
spritsail. By Uncle John's orders an air-tight box, made of tin, was
fitted into each end of the boat, so that, even if she were to be filled
with water, the air in the tin boxes would float her. She was painted
white outside, with a narrow blue streak, and dark brown inside. Harry
named her the <i>Whitewing</i>; and his mother made a beautiful silk signal
for her, which was to be carried at the sprit when under sail, and on a
small staff at the bow of the boat at other times. For oars there were
two pairs of light seven-foot sculls, and a pair of ten-foot oars, each
of which was to be pulled by a single boy. The rudder was fitted with a
yoke and a pair of lines, and the sail was of new and very light canvas.
On one side of the boat was a little locker, made to hold a gun; and on
the other side were places for fishing-rods and fishing-tackle. When she
was brought around to Harlem, and Harry saw her for the first time, he
was so overjoyed that he turned two or three hand-springs, bringing up
during the last one against a post&mdash;an exploit which nearly broke his
shin, and induced his uncle to remark that he would never rise to
distinction as a Moral Pirate unless he could give up turning
hand-springs while on duty.</p>

<p>Harry could row very fairly, for he belonged to a boat club at school.
It was not very much of a club; but then the club boat was not very much
of a boat, being a small, flat-bottomed skiff, which leaked so badly
that she could not be kept afloat unless one boy kept constantly at work
bailing. However, Harry learned to row in her, and he now found this
knowledge very useful. He was anxious to start on the cruise
immediately, but his uncle insisted that the crew must first be trained.
"I must teach you to sail, and you must teach your crew to row," said
Uncle John. "The Department will never consent to let a boat go on a
cruise unless her commander and her crew know their duty."</p>

<p>"What's the Department?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>"The Navy Department in the United States service has the whole charge
of the navy, and sends vessels where it pleases. Now I consider that I
represent a Department of Moral Piracy, and I therefore superintend the
fitting out of the <i>Whitewing</i>. You can't expect moral piracy to
flourish unless you respect the Department, and obey its orders."</p>

<p>"All right, uncle," replied Harry. "Of course the Department furnishes
stores and everything else for a cruise, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it must," said his uncle, laughing. "I didn't think of that
when I proposed to become a Department."</p>

<p>The boys met every day at Harlem, and practiced rowing. Uncle John
taught them how to sail the boat, by letting them take her out under
sail when there was very little breeze, while he kept close alongside in
another boat very much like the <i>Whitewing</i>. Harry sat in the
stern-sheets, holding the yoke lines. Tom Schuyler, who was fourteen
years old, and a boy of more than usual prudence, sat on the nearest
thwart, and held the sheet, which passed under a cleat without being
made fast to it, in his hand. Next came Jim Sharpe, whose business it
was to unship the mast when the captain should order sail to be taken
in; and on the forward thwart sat Joe Sharpe, who was not quite twelve,
and who kept the boat-hook within reach, so as to use it on coming to
shore. The boys kept the same positions when rowing, Tom Schuyler being
the stroke. Uncle John told them that if every one always had the same
seat, and had a particular duty assigned to him, it would prevent
confusion and dispute, and greatly increase the safety of the vessel and
crew.</p>

<p>It was not long before Harry could sail the boat nicely, and the others,
by attending closely to Uncle John's lessons, learned almost as much as
their young captain. So far as boat-sailing can be taught in fair
weather, Harry was carefully and thoroughly taught in six or seven
lessons, and could handle the <i>Whitewing</i> beautifully; but the ability
to judge of the weather, to tell when it is going to blow, and how the
wind will probably shift, can, of course, be learned only by actual
experience.</p>

<h2><a name="A_TREE_ALBUM" id="A_TREE_ALBUM"></a>A TREE ALBUM.</h2>

<p>Many of our boys and girls, we venture to say, would like to know how to
make a collection of specimens illustrating the trees of their own
neighborhood and of other parts of the country. We hardly need remind
them that the only way to get a complete knowledge and to enjoy the
beauty of natural objects is to examine them closely, and find out all
their little peculiarities. We may take long walks through the groves
and woods, and spend a great deal of time there, and yet when we get
home we may know very little about them. We might remember that we had
seen a great many trees, but not be able to tell of what kinds they
were, how their branches and leaves were shaped, how tall they were, or
anything about them.</p>

<p>Now such knowledge is very pleasant to have, and will afford a great
deal of pure enjoyment. The more we know about the beautiful trees, the
more we will value them, and find entertainment in admiring them.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to bring home from our rambles small portions of them,
so that we can examine them minutely at our leisure. The bark, the
leaves, and the blossoms are the most important; they are what we look
at to recognize a tree, and we should have specimens of each. The first
necessary step is to find some way of arranging and preserving them. A
good method is to get some pasteboard or stout paper, and cut it into
sheets of convenient size&mdash;say eight inches long and five wide. Then a
box will be needed to keep them in, so that they will not get lost or
soiled. Give one sheet to each tree, and upon it paste a piece of the
bark, a leaf, and a blossom. The bark should not be taken from the tree
where it is too coarse and clumsy, but where it is nearly smooth and
perfect, and gives the best idea of the tree; nor should too thin a
piece be taken, as when it gets dry it may wrinkle up and crumble to
pieces. It may be well to take off with the bark a thin layer of the
wood to stiffen it and keep it smooth. A piece of bark about three
inches long and two wide would be of a good size.</p>

<p>The blossoms will have to be pressed and dried before they are attached
to the sheet. Take care to lay them so as to show the face and the
inside parts as plainly as possible. It may be well in some cases to
press two or more blossoms, laying them in different positions, so that
every part can be seen.</p>

<p>The leaves will be easy, as they are mostly flat. If they are small,
several may be taken, or a little twig. If the under side of the leaf is
very different from the upper, or is remarkable for its hairs, or for
any reason, one leaf should be placed with the under side upward. Care
should be taken to do the pasting neatly, so that the sheet will look
pretty, and the parts can be readily examined by the eye alone, or with
a magnifying-glass or microscope, which reveals many interesting facts
that can not be discovered by the eye unassisted.</p>

<p>In this way the trees can be studied at any time, even in winter, when
the world outside is bare and dreary, and the evenings are long, and
afford fine opportunity for such amusement. And what is more important
still, the sheets prepared as we have shown can be sent through the mail
to distant parts of the land, where the trees displayed on them do not
grow, and are wholly unknown.</p>

<p>Thus our young readers, scattered over the United States and Canada and
elsewhere, can supply each other with specimens, so that each may make
up a collection from the trees growing over a very wide area.</p>

<p>Most trees are very long lived, and some are still living that are known
to be hundreds of years old. Certain kinds of wood, too, seem almost
incapable of decay if protected from the weather.</p>

<p>Probably the oldest timber in the world which has been used by man is
that found in the ancient temples of Egypt, in connection with the
stone-work, which is known to be at least four thousand years old. This,
the only wood used in the construction of the temple, is in the form of
ties, holding the end of one stone to another. When two blocks were laid
in place, an excavation about an inch deep was made in each block, into
which a tie shaped like an hour-glass was driven.</p>

<p>The ties appear to have been of the tamarisk or shittim wood, of which
the ark was constructed&mdash;a sacred tree in ancient Egypt, and now very
rarely found in the valley of the Nile. The dovetailed ties are just as
sound now as on the day of their insertion. Although fuel is extremely
scarce in the country, these bits of wood are not large enough to make
it an object with the Arabs to heave off layer after layer to obtain
them. Had they been of bronze, half the old temples would have been
destroyed years ago.</p>

<p>If those among our young friends who are alive to the charms of nature
will arrange some specimens of trees on the plan we have explained, and
label the sheets with the common names of the trees, and the scientific
names also, if they can find them out from their parents, we will be
glad to hear from them, and will publish their letters in the
Post-office Box, so that they can make exchanges with each other.</p>

<p>Very little folks, who may find it too hard to get the bark and the
blossoms, can begin by making collections simply of the leaves. Be
careful to cut the sheets exactly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span> of the size we have mentioned, so
that when laid together they will make a nice even pile like a book.
And, remember, don't send them to us; only write, and let the
Post-office Box know when you have them ready for exchange. We will
publish the fact in the <span class="smcap">Young People</span>, so that you can send the specimens
to each other, and make up the collections among yourselves.</p>

<p>Frank Austin's duties as supercargo were soon over, and he decided to go
ashore and look about him. The moment he was seen looking over the side,
a clamor arose from the Chinese boats around the steamer, which reminded
him of the chorus of monkeys and parrots at Gibraltar.</p>

<p>"Good boatee, my&mdash;no upset!"</p>

all the boatmen, and boat-women too (for there were plenty of the
latter), seemed to be exactly alike, so that if he picked one, and
happened to lose him, it would be no joke to find him again. As he stood
hesitating, a good-looking Chinese girl hailed him from a neat little
boat with a staring red eye painted on side of its bow.</p>

<p>"Hi! say! My namee Whampoa Sam; washee, keepee state-loom, row boat, can
do all for two bob [fifty cents]. Come tly!"</p>

<p>Such a list of accomplishments was not to be resisted, and Austin at
once took his seat under the stern awning. The young woman spread her
sail, and turned the boat shoreward, steering it with an immense oar.</p>

<p>Away they went, past huge high-pooped junks that looked like monster
rocking-chairs; past stately English steamers, beside which the little
painted sampans seemed mere toys; past big clumsy rice barges, and trim
gigs pulled by sturdy Western sailors. While threading her way through
this maze of shipping as dexterously as any seaman, the girl found time
to answer Frank's eager questions upon all that he saw, down to the
staring eyes on the bow of her boat, which, as she explained, were meant
to "help boatee see go straight, allee same man's eye." The mystery of
her masculine name, which had puzzled Austin not a little, was also
cleared up.</p>

<p>"My Whampoa Sam <i>wife</i>; Sam up Canton side now&mdash;can catchee more piecee
dollar there. My row boatee till come back. Work boatee, my, allee same
man. Choy! you no b'lieve? Bime-by pickaninny Sam row boatee too, muchee
ploper. Look see!"</p>

</div>

<p>She pushed aside a plank, and hauled out of a box underneath it a little
round-faced "four-year-old," so like a big doll that Frank almost took
him for one, till he saw the child grasp the steering oar in his little
pudgy hands, and actually steer the boat to shore.</p>

<p>"Well," thought our hero, "the Chinese may well be good boatmen, if they
begin as early as that."</p>

<p>But he afterward learned that on the great Chinese rivers thousands of
families live altogether in boats, each of which has an allotted place
of its own. In Canton alone these floating streets have a population of
300,000, and it is common to see two-year-old children toddling about
with small wooden buoys on their backs, fixed there by their careful
mothers in case they should fall overboard, which they do, on an
average, three or four times a day.</p>

<p>For several hundred feet around the great stone quay extended a perfect
army of Chinese boats, clustering together like bees; but Mrs. Sam soon
made her way through them, and Austin leaped ashore. He had hardly done
so when a crowd of sturdy natives surrounded him, with ear-piercing
screams, asking if he wished to "ride in chair." This being a new idea,
he accepted at once, and presently found himself being carried off in a
sedan-chair by four sinewy fellows, who went at a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span> long swinging trot,
like the "palanquin hamals" of British India.</p>

</div>

<p>Six more runners were speedily added, for the way now led up a street
made entirely of stairs, like the "Hundred-and-one Steps" at
Constantinople. Then out into the open country, and away toward the
summit of Victoria Peak. Up, up, they went, poor Frank getting so bumped
about that he was sorely tempted to get out and walk; but he reached the
top at last, and saw the whole town, the harbor, and miles upon miles of
the inland country out-spread below him like a map. The trip, when paid
for, proved wonderfully cheap, though the reason given for this made
Frank feel rather "cheap" himself:</p>

<p>"Large piecee man, two bob; small piecee man, <i>like you</i>, one bob. All
right&mdash;chin-chin!"</p>

<p>During his rambles through the town Austin saw many curious sights. He
was shown through a native bank, where three Chinese "tellers" were
standing ankle-deep in gold, and counting so rapidly that the ring of
the coins sounded like one continuous chime. In another place a house
was being built <i>from the roof downward</i>, and he was told that "rain
come, walls muchee hurt, so put up roof first!"</p>

<p>Having now reached the farthest point of his voyage, Frank began to
think about getting home again, and finding that all who had shipped on
the <i>Arizona</i> were entitled, by the terms of their agreement, to a free
passage in the next homeward-bound steamer, he went down to the
company's office to get his ticket.</p>

<p>As he passed the open window a familiar voice from within caught his
ear. It was that of his Captain, who was having a talk with the
company's agent.</p>

<p>"I really don't know whom to send with this cargo," said the agent. "It
<i>must</i> go in a day or two, and none of my clerks can be spared. Do <i>you</i>
know of anybody, Gray?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's a young fellow who came out with me, that might do. He's
rather young, certainly, but I put him in charge at Singapore, and he
did very well. Hello! there he is. Austin!"</p>

<p>Frank entered, cap in hand.</p>

<p>"My lad," said the Captain, "we're sending a cargo of tin and opium to
Canton, and you might take it up, unless you'd rather go home."</p>

<p>"I <i>was</i> thinking of going, sir," said Austin; "but if you have anything
for me to do till I can get letters from home, I shall be very glad to
do it."</p>

<p>"All right, my boy. Just look in here to-morrow morning, and we'll
arrange it."</p>

<p>The next morning, sure enough, Frank received his appointment, and set
sail up the river for Canton a few days later, with a handful of the
<i>Arizona's</i> picked men for his crew, and old Herrick as his second in
command&mdash;the latter remarking, with a grin, that "'twarn't a bad start
for a youngster to begin his first v'y'ge as coal-heaver, and end it as
Cap'n."</p>

<p>Our hero's farther adventures in China&mdash;how he succeeded so well with
his first cargo as to be at once intrusted with a second&mdash;how he
received letters from home, reporting all well&mdash;how he studied the ins
and outs of the "up-country" trade, and the ways of the Chinese, finding
both very different from what he had imagined&mdash;and how he soon got a
good appointment in the office, which he held for several years&mdash;would
make too long a story to be told here. But he always bore in mind the
last words of old Herrick, which were:</p>

<p>"Frank, my son, next time you meet a young feller wantin' to run away to
sea, jist you tell him you've tried it yourself, and 'tain't so nice as
it looks. If a lad goes to sea 'cause he's fit for it, and ain't 'fraid
o' <i>hard work</i>, well and good; but if he goes 'cause he's quarrelled
with his bread and butter, all along o' stuffin' his head with dime
novels and sich like rubbish, I guess he'll end where you began&mdash;in the
coal-hole. Now don't you forget them words o' mine." And Frank never
did.</p>

<h2><a name="SETTING_THE_BROOK_TO_WORK" id="SETTING_THE_BROOK_TO_WORK"></a>SETTING THE BROOK TO WORK.</h2>

<h3>BY WILLIAM O. STODDARD.</h3>

<p>The brook had never done a stroke of work in its life. So long, at
least, as Mart Benson could remember, it had gurgled across the foot of
his father's garden, tumbling heels over head down the little fall in
the middle, as if it knew it had got into some place that didn't belong
to it, and was in a desperate hurry to get out.</p>

<p>Then it made a dive under the fence, into Squire Spencer's orchard, and
then under another fence, and through a low stone archway across the
river road.</p>

<p>That was the end of the brook, for the river let it right in without so
much as saying, "How do you do?"</p>

<p>"It isn't more'n two feet across anywhere," said Mart to himself. "It
isn't so much as that just above the fall, and it's a foot and a half
below the top of the bank. I could make a dam there, and a flume."</p>

<p>Mart was a great whittler.</p>

<p>Mr. Jellicombe, the carpenter, used to say of him that when he wasn't
whittling, it was because he had had to stop to sharpen his knife.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mart, in reply to that, "what's the fun of whittling with a
dull knife? If you want a knife to cut straight and smooth, you've got
to have an edge on it."</p>

<p>So there was always a pretty good edge on his, and it was curious what
things he managed to carve out with it.</p>

<p>He had made a wooden chain out of a long square stick that Mr.
Jellicombe brought to the house to mend a door frame with. He had made
kites, walking-sticks, bats, wooden spoons and forks, a little wagon,
and any number of other things, of which about all that could be said
was that they gave him plenty of good whittling.</p>

<p>But Mart had been to the mill the day before, and had waited there two
hours while his father was having a grist of corn ground. All those two
hours had been spent by Mart with a shingle in one hand and his knife in
the other, but at the end of them there was hardly a notch in the
shingle, and Mart shut up his knife, and put it back in his pocket.</p>

<p>He had been watching the great water-wheel and the flume that brought
the water to it from the pond. He had studied the dam, too, and had been
thinking of the brook in his father's garden.</p>

<p>The more he looked at it now, the clearer he saw that it was high time
for that brook to be doing something.</p>

<p>It was easy enough to gather flat stones and pile them in at the narrow
place at the top of the fall. That was little more than a foot high, to
be sure, but the dam would more than double it.</p>

<p>Then he begged a couple of old raisin boxes at the store where his
father traded, and when the ends were knocked out of them, and they were
firmly set in the top of the little dam, one behind the other, they made
a good enough flume. The end of the foremost one stuck out beyond the
stones, and the water came pouring from it beautifully.</p>

<p>It took all the rest of that day for Mart to get the brook penned in and
compelled to run through the raisin boxes, for he had to keep on putting
stones and sods and dirt behind the dam to strengthen it, as the water
rose higher and higher. It would not do to make a pond of the garden,
but so long as the brook did not overflow its banks it would do no harm.
Sometimes it had run over in the spring, or after very heavy
rain-storms.</p>

<p>The next day Mart hardly went near his new dam, and he was a very
serious and busy boy indeed, considering that he was only thirteen.</p>

<p>A piece of wood had to be found first two and a half inches square, and
about a foot and a half long. It took a great deal of work to shave down
the four corners of that piece of wood till it had eight smooth sides
all just alike. Then Mart was compelled to go over to Jellicombe's
carpenter shop and put his piece of wood in a vise, so it would be held
steady, while he took a saw and sawed a long groove, more than half an
inch deep, in the middle of each one of those eight faces. Jellicombe
told him he had done that job very well.</p>

<p>"Looks like a hub for something. Going to make a wheel this time?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you. May I take your inch auger and bore a hole in each end?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead. If you ain't kerful, you'll split yer timber."</p>

<p>Mart was careful then, but he had trouble before him. He had picked out
a number of very straight shingles, and he was whittling away on these
now as if he was being paid for it. He cut them down to six inches long,
and shaved them at the sides, so that two pieces laid together were just
a foot wide. With a little more whittling after that he fitted them all,
one by one, into the eight grooves in his "hub," and his "water-wheel"
was done. A proud boy was Mart, but he ought to have kept on being
"careful."</p>

<p>"Look out!" said Mr. Jellicombe, as Mart rapped hard on one of the
shingle pieces, to drive it in more firmly; but it was too late.</p>

<p>"Crack!" the hub was split from end to end.</p>

<p>"Got to go to work and make a new one," said Mart, ruefully.</p>

<p>"Guess I wouldn't. Just take a couple of two-inch screws, and screw that
together again. It'll be stronger'n it was before."</p>

<p>That was a capital idea, and it only took a few minutes; to carry it
into effect.</p>

<p>"Make your end pins of hard wood," said Mr. Jellicombe; "and shave 'em
smooth. Then they'll run easy."'</p>

<p>That was easy enough, but one of those "endpins" was made of an old
broom handle, and was more than a foot long.</p>

<p>"I see what you're up to," said the carpenter, with a grin. "You've made
a right down good job of it, too. Grease your journals before you let
'em get wet."</p>

<p>Mart's "journals" for his end pins to run in were two holes he bored in
a couple of boards. When these were stuck up on each side of the lower
end of his flume, and the water-wheel was set in its place, Mart took
off his hat and shouted,</p>

<p>"Hurrah! the brook's at work!"</p>

<p>So it was, for it was rushing fiercely through the two old raisin boxes,
and down upon the wide "paddles" of Mart's wheel, and this was spinning
around at a tremendous rate.</p>

<p>"You've done it!"</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mr. Jellicombe? I didn't know you'd come."</p>

<p>"You've done it. Now what?"</p>

<p>"Why, I'm going to put another wheel on this long end pin, and set
another one above it, and put a strap over both of them."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it. Going to make a pulley and band. All right. It'll run.
There's plenty of water-power. But what then? Going to build a mill?"</p>

<p>"Guess not. All I care for is, I've set the brook to work."</p>

<p>"Why don't you make it do something, then, now you've found out how?"</p>

<p>"Don't know of anything small enough for a brook like that."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, then. There's your mother's big churn, that goes with a
crank. You whittle out a wheel twice as large as that, and set it a
little stronger, and raise your dam a few inches, and you can run that
churn."</p>

<p>"Hurrah! I'll do it!"</p>

<p>There was a good deal of busy whittling before Mart finished that second
job, but before two weeks were over there was butter on Mrs. Benson's
dinner table which had actually been churned by the brook at the bottom
of the garden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="HOW_THE_SECRET_WAS_STOLEN" id="HOW_THE_SECRET_WAS_STOLEN"></a>HOW THE SECRET WAS STOLEN.</h2>

<p>Benjamin Huntsman, a native of Lincolnshire, England, was the inventor
of cast steel. The discovery was kept a great secret, and as the success
it obtained was very great, many efforts were made to find out how it
was prepared.</p>

<p>One cold winter's night, while the snow was falling in heavy flakes, and
Huntsman's manufactory threw its red glare of light over the
neighborhood, a person of the most abject appearance presented himself
at the entrance, praying for permission to share the warmth and shelter
which it afforded. The humane workmen found the appeal irresistible, and
the apparent beggar was permitted to take up his quarters in a warm
corner of the building.</p>

<p>A careful scrutiny would have discovered little real sleep in the
drowsiness that seemed to overtake the stranger; for he eagerly watched
every movement of the workmen while they went through the operations of
the newly discovered process.</p>

<p>He observed, first of all, that bars of blistered steel were broken into
small pieces, two or three inches in length, and placed in crucibles of
fire-clay. When nearly full, a little green glass, broken into small
fragments, was spread over the top, and the whole covered with a closely
fitting cover. The crucibles were then placed in a furnace, and after a
lapse of from three to four hours, during which the crucibles were
examined from time to time, to see that the metal was thoroughly melted,
the workmen lifted the crucible from its place on the furnace by means
of tongs, and its molten contents, blazing, sparkling, and spurting,
were poured into a mould of cast iron. When cool, the mould was
unscrewed, and a bar of cast steel was presented.</p>

<p>The uninvited spectator of these operations effected his escape without
detection, and before many months had passed the Huntsman manufactory
was not the only one where cast steel was produced.</p>

<h3>BY F.&nbsp;E. FRYATT.</h3>

<p>"Hip, hip, hurrah! to-morrow's my birthday, Miss Eleanor," shouted Harry
Lewis, bursting into my garden like a young hurricane. "Cousin Jack's
coming over from New York, Nell's got a holiday, and father says if
you'll decide and go with us, we may have a jollification somewhere."</p>

<p>"How delightful! Of course I'll go, with the greatest pleasure. Suppose
we choose Prospect Park?"</p>

<p>"Capital! Miss Eleanor, good-by; excuse haste. I'm off to tell Nell, and
hurry mother with the birthday cake and the fixin's."</p>

<p>Old Prob predicted fair weather, and he was as good as his word, for the
sun shone in the bluest of skies, and the morning was fresh and breezy,
when Nell and I stepped into an open car, followed by Harry, Jack, and
the family lunch basket.</p>

<p>Every one looked happy, and even the car horses trotted briskly along
the broad avenue to the Plaza as if they knew we were anxious to be
there.</p>

<p>Arrived at the Park, the two boys put their wise heads together, and
gallantly agreed that I should be captain of the party, a decision they
shortly after announced in an important manner.</p>

<p>"Follow your leader, then," said I, helping Nell into one of the large
phaetons standing near the entrance.</p>

<p>"All right," responded Harry, as the whip cracked, and away dashed the
horses in fine style.</p>

<p>Now we swept past velvety fields and wood-crowned hills; now we rolled
softly under arches of tremulous green; then through miniature valleys
between blossoming heights; now through shadowy forests, and away again
beside open meadows.</p>

<p>"How lovely!" cried Nell, rapturously, as one moment we caught the
glitter of a distant lake, the next the twinkle of a reedy pool overhung
with hazel and alder bushes.</p>

<p>Even the boys were stirred to delight, when, crossing a rustic bridge,
they could look down and see a dashing cascade tumble and foam over
mossy precipices, till it reached a stony basin below, where it lay
golden and clear as a topaz.</p>

<p>On and on we sped, past new wonders of blossoming groves and ferny
hollows, to the end of our ride.</p>

<p>Which way to turn, after we left our basket at the Lodge, we knew not.
Labyrinthine walks met us in every direction, leading to bowers and
dells and wildernesses innumerable.</p>

<p>"Let us take the nearest," said I; and away we went, tripping it gayly,
till the path ended unexpectedly at the loveliest bower imaginable, all
hidden with clambering vines and shrubbery, from which peeped out a
thatched roof, with two odd little peaks, surrounded by bird-houses.</p>

<p>Past its pretty arches, as we sat on the rustic seats, we could look
upon acres of velvety meadow, dotted with wild flowers, and gay with
groups of pleasure-seekers.</p>

<p>Near by, Madam Nurse trundled Miss Baby; yonder, a company of girls
played at "bean bags"; further on, the croquet-players were busy with
mallets and balls; while passing to and fro were troops of
school-children making the most of their weekly holiday.</p>

<p>"Listen!" cried Nell, suddenly, as sounds of music were borne to us on
the breeze.</p>

<p>"It's 'Nancy Lee'; go for it!" shouted Harry, leaping over the railing,
and darting across the meadow.</p>

<p>"Come on; follow the sound, girls," cried Jack, bounding after him.</p>

<p>Nell and I take the path sedately, "hastening slowly," for we can not
help stopping to listen to the soft twitter of the birds, to admire the
golden laburnums; we even wait to let a sparrow hop leisurely down the
walk before us.</p>

<p>We have had time to spare, for when we arrive in sight of the
"merry-go-round" in its pretty pavilion, the musical history of Nancy
Lee is still being repeated.</p>

<p>But a pretty vision greets us. Whirl, whirl, whirl, flies a magic ring
of boys and girls, with their fluttering ribbons, bright eyes, and
tossing curls.</p>

<p>Click, click, clash a score of shining blades, as the eager riders, with
parted lips, lean forward and try to pick off the rings from a
projecting bar.</p>

<p>Now the music begins to die away; the circle moves slower, and slower,
and slower.</p>

<p>"Count your rings!" shouts the man in charge. "The biggest number wins
the free ride."</p>

<p>"Sixteen, eighteen, twenty," calls out Harry, triumphantly, adding, as
he spies Nellie, "There's my sister; give her a ride."</p>

<p>Nothing loath, Nell is strapped on a gray pony, and waits impatiently
for the music. The seats fill, the organ sounds forth, "I'm called
Little Buttercup," and away they float as light as feathers.</p>

<p>"It is well they're so merry," groans the poor horse beneath them in the
cellar, as he treads his weary beat; "they'd find it a sad-go-round if
we changed places."</p>

<p>The noon hour strikes; the merry-go-round man is mortal, and wants his
dinner, which reminds us that it is time to send for the lunch basket.</p>

<p>Choosing a lovely spot under a spreading elm in the meadow, we lay the
cloth, set out our luncheon, brew a pitcher of fine lemonade, and sit
down, the merriest of merry parties.</p>

<p>In the midst of our entertainment four uninvited but welcome visitors
make their appearance. Guess who they are.</p>

<p>A toad came first, and sat blinking at us with the funniest airs
imaginable. Then a robin-redbreast and two sparrows edged their way up
to our table with great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span> caution, winked at us with bright eyes,
concluded we were trustworthy, and ventured to peck at the crumbs we
scattered for them.</p>

</div>

<p>Gathering up the remnants of our feast, we wended our way to a pretty
summer-house overlooking a small lake, in which sported a multitude of
gold-fish, a pair of swans, some geese, and a bevy of ducks with lovely
rings of red, purple, and gold-green feathers about their necks.</p>

<p>Here Nell and the boys found fine sport throwing crackers into the
water, and watching the ducks and fishes rush for them, but came away in
high disgust because one old drake gave the ducks and fishes hardly any
chance at all, but darted and dived and bobbed about so fast that he
grabbed a dozen pieces to their one.</p>

<p>"Good-by, old greedy; hope you'll never come up again!" cried Jack,
moving away, as the nimble fellow dove head-first till nothing but his
funny tail flirted above the water.</p>

<p>A peep at the deer, pony-rides for the boys, and a drive in the
goat-carriage for Nell, varied our ramble to the Aerial Skating Rink,
which we found on the other side of the Park.</p>

<p>As we came in sight of the elevated square of asphalt pavement, with its
gay cavalcade of skaters flitting to and fro inside the railings, the
boys hurrahed with delight.</p>

<p>"It's perfectly glorious; let's try it," shouted Harry, bounding down
the hill-side, followed closely by Jack.</p>

<p>"I could do that too," said Nell, imitating the movements of the
skaters.</p>

<p>"You shall try," replied I; and a minute later we were inside the
square, bargaining for a lesson on the odd three-wheeled triangular
arrangement, with its horse's head and handled reins.</p>

<p>"Plant your feet firmly on this brace," said the instructor, showing
Nell the iron bar; "hold the reins well in hand, bend your right knee,
and strike out with your foot as if skating; now your left; and away you
go."</p>

<p>Sure enough, off shot Nell, managing to keep up a tolerable speed, then
slacking, then increasing, then coming to a dead halt, as Jack,
shouting, "Clear the track!" bore down on her car, almost upsetting it.</p>

<p>"A miss is as good as a mile," screams Harry, flying by on the other
side, with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>"Strike out, little girl!" cries a lad, giving Nell's car a push, and
sending her speeding along. In and out, around and about, they fly, like
mimic charioteers, until, fairly exhausted, they are willing to stop,
and go over to the Rotary Yacht, whose snow-white wings are visible from
the hill-top.</p>

<p>A pleasant walk across the sloping meadow and along by the side of a
small lake brings us to this novel boat, which is merely a great hollow
ring of seats, with oars and rowlocks for calm, and sails for breezy,
weather.</p>

<p>We step in and sit down; the wind, coming in soft puffs from the south,
sends us floating around and around with a dreamy, restful motion that
our tired little charioteers thoroughly appreciate as they lean back and
trail their hands idly through the cool water.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said I at last, "wake up for our row on the lake,
sleepers, and then heigho for home and supper!"</p>

<p>"I was only fooling, Miss Eleanor; I'm fresh as a lark," cried Harry,
leaping nimbly out on the platform.</p>

<p>"So am I," said Jack, lending a hand to Nellie.</p>

<p>"The Rotary Yacht will do for a rest, but this is what I call life,"
exclaimed Harry, as later he and Jack, with even sweep of the oars, sent
our pretty boat skimming over the waters of the lake.</p>

<p>Now we sped around curving shores, and past grassy capes; now we skirted
fairy islands and reedy shallows; then under hollow bridges, that gave
back jolly echoes to Nell's laughter and the dip of the oars.</p>

<p>"Quick, quick&mdash;quick, quick," screamed a bevy of ducks, hurrying to
shore, as we rounded a woody bend in the lake, and came upon them with a
rush that sent the water in diamond showers over their backs.</p>

<p>"Tirra-la, tirra-la," whistled a wood-thrush in the grove; "tirra-la,
tirra-la," answered another.</p>

<p>"Ah! that's a warning, children; he sings at sunset. See the light
shooting gold green through the trees; that means that our happy day is
over. And there's another sign; look over your right shoulder&mdash;the new
moon."</p>

<p>"Tu-whit, tu-whoo, good-night to you," hooted an owl, as we turned our
boat homeward.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed; we are going," sighed Harry, half sad that the jolly
day at Prospect Park was ended.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="A_BATTLE_ON_THE_BUFFALO_RANGE" id="A_BATTLE_ON_THE_BUFFALO_RANGE"></a>A BATTLE ON THE BUFFALO RANGE.</h2>

<p>Between the half-breeds who form a large portion of the population of
the settlements of the Northwest, along the Red River of the North, and
their neighbors, the Sioux, exists a bitter enmity. Peace is seldom
declared between them, and when parties of Sioux and half-breeds meet,
bloody battles are the result.</p>

<p>Although the half-breeds are more civilized than the Indians, and live
in villages, generally near the forts or trading posts, they depend
largely upon buffalo-meat for their winter food, and upon buffalo-robes,
for which the traders give them guns, powder, shot, blankets, tea,
coffee, sugar, and other necessaries and luxuries of their life. To
obtain this meat and these robes they organize grand buffalo hunts every
summer and fall, each of which lasts for several months, and in which
hundreds of men engage. The hunters travel from their homes to the
distant hunting grounds on horseback; but they take with them long
trains of very curious-looking ox-carts, in which the women and
children, who go with their husbands and fathers on these long trips,
ride, and in which the buffalo-meat and hides are carried home.</p>

<p>The ox-carts, or "Pembina buggies," as they are often called, are very
strong and clumsy, and are made entirely of wood, generally by their
owners. The wooden wheels, turning on the ungreased wooden axles, make
the most horrible creaking and groaning; and when, as is often the case,
several hundred or a thousand of these carts are in one train, the noise
they make can be heard for miles.</p>

<p>Each cart is drawn by a single ox, attached to the rude shafts by a
simple and home-made harness of rawhide, with the aid of which the
patient beast draws a load of a thousand pounds for hundreds of miles,
at the rate of twenty or thirty miles a day.</p>

<p>As they approach the buffalo range, where they expect to find their
game, the hunters know that at any moment they may run across hunting
parties of the Sioux, and for them they keep a sharp look-out night and
day.</p>

<p>Some years ago a brave hunter by the name of Jean Bedell, whose home was
in Pembina, joined one of these great hunting parties, taking with him
his wife and their little child, a baby of but a few months old. The
party to which Jean belonged was so large that they had but little fear
of Indians, and did not guard against being surprised by them as
carefully as usual.</p>

<p>One morning as the brigade broke camp, and the long line of carts moved
slowly away toward Devil's Lake, which could be seen gleaming in the
distance, and near which the hunters felt sure they would find buffalo,
Jean Bedell found that a portion of his harness had given out, and he
must stay behind and mend it. He had just finished his task, and started
on after the carts, the groaning and screeching of which could still be
heard in the distance, when other and more terrible sounds, borne
clearly to his ear, caused him to come to a sudden halt.</p>

<p>The sounds that so startled him were quick shots, almost as steady as
volleys of musketry, and the terrible yell with which the Sioux charges
upon his enemy. Far down the valley the hunter could see sharp flashes
of fire pierce the cloud of dust that hung over the train of ox-carts,
and the dark mass of Sioux warriors charging down the hill-side, lashing
their ponies, firing and yelling as they went.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">CUT OFF.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Drawn by W.&nbsp;M. Cary.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Alone, and cut off from his companions, with his wife and baby to
protect, Jean Bedell had nothing to do but lie down, with his trusty
rifle in hand, powder and bullets by his side, and wait, determined to
sell his life as dearly as possible if worst came to worst.</p>

<p>For hours the hunter watched the fight, while his wife<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span> crouched in the
bottom of the cart, with her baby in her arms. He could see that the
carts had been formed in a semicircle, and from behind them his comrades
withstood charge after charge of the Indians, who would dash up to the
barrier of heavy carts, pour in a volley, and sweep away beyond rifle
range, until their own guns were reloaded.</p>

<p>At last, late in the afternoon, the battle came to an end. The Indians,
finding it impossible to drive the hunters from behind their barrier,
suddenly withdrew, and taking their dead with them, disappeared over the
hill down which they had dashed in the morning. They might make another
attack, but for the present all was safe, and Jean Bedell might rejoin
his friends. When he reached them, he found that though they were
rejoiced to have driven off the hated Sioux, their joy was mingled with
much sorrow, for there were many dead to be buried, and many wounded to
be cared for. Among the dead were several of the little children, to
whom stray bullets had found their way; and when Jean Bedell and his
wife saw the poor little bodies, they were very thankful that, on
account of a broken harness, their own darling baby had been kept at a
safe distance from the terrible battle.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF GEORGE WASHINGTON.</h2>

<h3>BY EDWARD CARY.</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter VIII</span>.</h3>

<p>I have said that the work which President Washington had to do was quite
new to the country. The people had been used to having all their affairs
attended to in their own States. None of the States was very large. Some
of them were very small, compared with what the States are now, so that
the public men in each were known by a greater part of the people than
they now are. Then distance seemed greater than it does now. It took
nearly as long to go from Boston to New York as it now does to go from
Boston to California; there was no telegraph any more than there were
railways and steam-boats, and news travelled as slowly as men did
themselves. You can see that it was harder for people in Georgia or New
Hampshire to know what was going on in New York than it is now for
people in Oregon or Florida to know what is being done in Washington.
Where there is ignorance there is always more distrust and doubt. Men
found it not easy to give up public business to a Congress, far away,
that they did not know much about. Washington set himself earnestly at
work to try and have things done so carefully, so honestly, and so
wisely, that the people would learn to trust the national government,
and live happily under it.</p>

<p>The national government had been meant especially to do three things:
First, to raise money and pay the debts of all the States; second, to
see that the country was rightly dealt with by other countries, and that
other countries were justly treated by our own; and third, in a general
way to do for the common good what no one State could do by itself.</p>

<p>The government has now for nearly a hundred years done this work very
well, and that fact is largely due to the way George Washington began
it. He was President for eight years.</p>

<p>It would not be easy to tell all the things he did in that time which
have had a good effect ever since, but it will be well to remember a few
of the principal ones. He always insisted on the full and honest payment
of the public debt, that is, of money borrowed by the government to
carry on the war, and so forth. He believed that a nation must keep its
word as much as a man must, if it expects other people to deal fairly
with it.</p>

<p>In order that the government might pay its debts, it was necessary for
it to get money from the people by taxes, and President Washington
showed very early that no man or set of men were to be allowed to refuse
to pay a fair share of these taxes, as fixed by law.</p>

<p>The people chose the Congress, and the Congress decided how the taxes
should be paid. When that was done, there must be no further dispute
about paying. If the people did not like the laws Congress made, they
could elect men to Congress who would change the laws, but until the
laws were changed in this way, they must be obeyed.</p>

<p>A large number of persons in the State of Pennsylvania refused to pay a
tax ordered by Congress, called an excise tax, which was a certain sum
on every barrel of whiskey made in the country. When Washington learned
of this, he sent word to these people that if they did not obey the
laws, he should have to compel them to; and as they took no notice of
this warning, he got together an army of 16,000 men, and sent it into
the State. This soon settled the trouble, and there has never been any
attempt, on a large scale, to resist a tax law in the United States
since then.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that Washington knew better than to do such a thing by
halves. He sent so large an army that to fight against it was hopeless,
and so there was no fighting.</p>

<p>It would have been well for the country if this wise example had always
been followed.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CHILD_SINGER" id="THE_CHILD_SINGER"></a>THE CHILD SINGER.</h2>

<h3>BY LAURA FITCH.</h3>

<p>In a narrow dirty street in the most miserable part of the great city of
London, a group of children were playing beside the gutter. They were
all dirty and ragged, and the faces of many were old and worldly-wise.
One little girl, however, though her dress was as torn and soiled as
that of any of the other dwellers in the filthy street, had a pretty
childish face. She was a bright-looking little one, with matted brown
hair hanging in tangled curls that had never known a brush, and a pair
of sweet dark eyes looking out trustfully into the uninviting world
around her. She stood a little apart from the others, leaning against
the doorway of a rickety tenement-house, humming softly to herself.</p>

<p>A rough-looking boy in the group by the gutter, hearing her low tones,
called out, "Louder, Nell; sing something."</p>

<p>The child obeyed; with her hands clasped, and her eyes fastened on the
speck of blue sky to be seen between the roofs of the tall, smoky
houses, she burst into a song. No wonder that the other children stopped
their noisy play, and listened. It was not their ignorance of music that
made the singing seem beautiful to those little street vagabonds. There
was in the clear voice of the child singer a strange, wistful tone, of
which she herself was unconscious, but which held the listener
spell-bound.</p>

<p>Nell had been born and bred in those low surroundings. She had never
seen the inside of a church, or heard other music than the whining tones
of a street organ, yet there was in her the very soul of music. She
lived in a wretched garret, with a dirty, slouchy woman whom she called
aunt, and loved as only a child or a woman can love one from whom she
receives no sign of affection. Miserable as such a life was, it might
have been worse.</p>

<p>One day Nell's aunt was brought home on a shutter; she had been run over
by a carriage, and instantly killed.</p>

<p>Now Nell was indeed destitute; no money, and no friends but her rough
neighbors. But these, though rough, were not hard-hearted; they would
have given her money, but they had none themselves, except what they
earned or stole each day. So they told her, if she wanted her aunt
buried properly, she must go out at night and sing, in which way she
would very likely earn enough, as people would pity so young a child.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>

<p>So that night poor little Nell set out on her work of love. She walked
till she reached the broad streets and handsome houses that form the
London which the world knows. Here she sang. In the clear silent night
the childish voice rang out, and the hour and the stillness made its
wistful tones sound wild and weird. Up one street and down another the
little figure went singing, while its heart seemed breaking. A strange
excitement bore her up, and she felt no fatigue.</p>

<p>Her pathetic appeal was not in vain; it seemed to touch the hearts, and,
what is more difficult, the pockets, of all who heard her. When midnight
came, she thought of stopping only because most of the houses had closed
for the night, and there was little more to be obtained. So she took her
last stand in front of a fine old house in Kensington Square, in whose
windows lights were still burning. It was the home of Barech, the great
musician. As the tones of Nell's voice broke on the stillness of the
night, he paused in the work he was doing, and after a moment rose and
threw open the window. With amazement he saw the little childish figure
standing in the light of the street lamp, and while his artist's ear
drank in the wonderful tones with delight, his fatherly heart filled
with pity for the desolate child. When Nell ceased, he called to her,
and descending, opened the door and took her in.</p>

<p>From that moment Nell was no longer destitute, no longer friendless. In
Barech she had found a friend who never deserted her. Captivated by her
voice, he took the little waif into his heart and home, and thenceforth
she was protected, cared for, and educated. And he was amply rewarded
when, in after-years, the fame of Helen Barech spread over England. No
one then ever dreamed that the great singer began her career years ago,
one dark night, under the stars, a little outcast singing for money to
bury her dead.</p>

<h2><a name="HES_MY_FRIEND_A_TRUE_STORY" id="HES_MY_FRIEND_A_TRUE_STORY"></a>"HE'S MY FRIEND."&mdash;A TRUE STORY.</h2>

<h3>BY AUNT FANNY.</h3>

<p>Charley was the son of a young, rich, and beautiful widow, who lived in
one of the splendid up-town hotels of New York city. His mother was a
very busy woman, for she was a manager of the "Children's Retreat," the
"Children's Relief," the "Old Ladies' Mitigation Society," and ever so
many other charities, and these took up so much of her time that her own
poor little half-orphaned Charley was left pretty much to himself; for
Lizzie, his nurse, spent most of her time laughing and talking with the
other servants.</p>

<p>So Charley amused himself running up and down the stairs, and taking
trips with the elevator man, who was very fond of the bright little
fellow.</p>

<p>One day Charley wandered down the wide stairs, and along a corridor or
hall. He was throwing up a little ball and catching it as he went. At
the end of the hall he saw through an open door another flight of
stairs, very narrow, and rather dark. It was the stairs for the
servants' use.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" cried Charley, "here are some more stairs," and like the
learned monkey that let nothing escape him on his travels, down the
stairs went the boy on a voyage of discovery.</p>

<p>When he came to the bottom, which was far below the level of the street
outside, he walked along to an open door, and saw something which
dimpled his face all over with smiles; for, standing like a heron on one
leg, leaning against the wall opposite the door, was <i>another boy</i>. He
was twirling a little paper windmill fastened to a stick; his great
black eyes were dancing with glee, and as he laughed he showed two rows
of snow-white even teeth. At a stationary wash-tub was a big woman
washing clothes, and singing softly to herself, "'Way down in ole
Virginny."</p>

<p>Neither of them saw Charley, so, by way of introducing himself, he said,
"Hallo, boy."</p>

<p>The woman turned quickly round, and exclaimed, "Why, honey, whar did yer
come from?"</p>

<p>"I came down stairs; may I come in?" asked Charley, adding, quickly, "I
want to play with that boy."</p>

<p>"Course you can; come right in," said the black woman, for she was
nearly as black as ink, but there was a sweet, honest expression in her
broad face, and a welcoming tone in her voice, which brought Charley
quickly in, with a little laugh, to the side of the other boy.</p>

<p>And he&mdash;oh, how black he was! but as clean and neatly dressed as soap
and water and nice clothes could make him, for Juliet, his mother, loved
her little son, and she took good care that his manners were as nice as
his clothes. He held out his hand to Charley, and, making a queer little
bow, said, "How do you do, sir? I hope you are very well." Then he
twisted one leg tighter than ever round the other, and gave a vigorous
twirl to his paper windmill.</p>

<p>"Hey! I like that," said Charley. "Let <i>me</i> try to do it."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said the other, "but this is the best way&mdash;to hold it straight
out, and run fast."</p>

<p>So Charley took the windmill, and both boys went scampering and
galloping round the room, the windmill flying round famously, until the
boys were quite out of breath.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" asked Charley, as they were resting together in a
large old rocking-chair.</p>

<p>"George Washington Johnson. What's <i>your</i> name?"' asked the black boy,
in return, rocking the chair as hard as he could.</p>

<p>"My name is Charley Lee. I like you. Will you be my friend?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes; will you be mine?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and we'll play together every single day."</p>

<p>Just then Juliet went away with a great basket of clothes, to hang them
up in a room where they were quickly dried by steam; and Charley, taking
George's hand, said, "Come up stairs with me, and take a ride in the
elevator."</p>

<p>What a blissful invitation for George! They tumbled up stairs in their
delightful hurry, ran through the door into the broad hall, to the
elevator, and the moment it appeared, Charley cried out,</p>

<p>"Oh, Mike, open the door; George wants to ride up and down with me;
<i>he's my friend</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's your friend, is he?" said Mike, puckering up his eyes at
George Washington; "and a very pretty color he is, too. Well, step in,
Snowball."</p>

<p>"His name isn't Snowball; it's George Washington," said Charley.</p>

<p>The elevator man laughed, and the two boys got closer together in a
corner, pretending that it was a balloon, and they were sailing up and
down in the air; and there they sat, in a state of perfect happiness.</p>

<p>The two boys never quarrelled. George had a sweet disposition, and was
ready to do anything Charley proposed. They loved each other dearly, and
many were the slices of bread and butter, spread thickly over with
molasses, to which the two friends were treated by the good-natured
washer-woman. They never sat down to eat them; oh no! they capered, and
danced, and burst out laughing when they tumbled over a broomstick or a
bench, and seemed to grow rosier and fatter every day. That is, Charley
grew rosier, and George's smooth black skin grew shinier, which was the
same thing&mdash;for him.</p>

<p>The little black boy was often permitted by his mother to go out toward
Fourth Avenue, and run over one of the high arched bridges which covers
the Fourth Avenue Railroad, and he did not think he was doing wrong when
one day he asked Charley to go too.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I will," he cried, in a great state of delight.</p>

<p>As soon as they arrived at the bridge, they began chasing each other
over it; and then Charley said:</p>

<p>"Oh, George, let's play that we are travellers, hunting for a whale. I
heard my mamma talking about one that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span> was on ex-ex-exedition down by
the river. She said that it was 'most a mile long."</p>

<p>"Goody!" cried George. "What a mons'ous whale!"</p>

<p>So the boys ran down the street toward the East River a long, long way,
and presently they got to some rocks, upon the top of which were a
number of miserable wooden houses called shanties.</p>

<p>Geese, pigs, chickens, and a forlorn, starved-looking dog were poking
about for something to eat. Near by was a great heap of coal ashes. Some
bad-looking boys were raking the ashes up into a sort of mound on top of
the heap; but a moment after, they ran away to see an organ-grinder and
a monkey which had come upon the rocks. Charley and George would have
run too, had not their ears caught the sound of a stifled piteous
mewing, which seemed to issue out of the very middle of the ash heap.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked both boys at once.</p>

<p>"Mew! me&mdash;ew!" came again from the ashes.</p>

<p>"It's a cat!" exclaimed Charley; "and it is inside of those ashes. I do
believe those boys thought it was dead, and buried it. Let's hurry and
dig it out."</p>

<p>Charley and George worked hard, but they had nothing but their hands to
work with, and they threw the ashes all over their clothes; but the
piteous mewing came quicker and louder, and in a few moments the gray
head of a live kitten popped out of the ashes; then two gray paws, and
soon the whole kitten was liberated.</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor little thing!" said Charley, trying with soft pats to get
the ashes out of its fur, while George took out of his pocket a queer
little pocket-handkerchief, six inches square, with A B C all round the
edge, and a portrait of his great namesake in the middle, and said, in a
tender tone, "Here, poor kitty, let me wipe your nose; don't cry any
more;" and he wiped it so softly that it really seemed to comfort the
afflicted little creature.</p>

<p>"Let's run home with it," said Charley.</p>

<p>"And give it some milk," said George.</p>

<p>"And wash it clean," said Charley.</p>

<p>"And dry it in the steam-room," said George.</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. Charley carried the kitten one block, and then
George the next, and so on in turn, until at last they got back to the
hotel, and rushed down into the laundry, where Juliet was beginning to
feel worried at their long absence.</p>

<p>"La sakes!" she cried, when she saw the plight they were in, "whar have
you ben gone? Why, you look jes like ole Bobby de ash-man. Whar you get
dat ar cat? Why, George Washington! you's a disgrace to your raisin'!
How you spec' I'se gwine' to make you look genteel if you cum home dat
ar way?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said George, rolling his eyes at his mother&mdash;"oh, we've had such
s'prising 'wenters; we went to see a whale."</p>

<p>"Whale! is dat what you call a whale?" said Juliet, pointing to the poor
little kitten, which he was hugging tight to his breast.</p>

<p>Then Charley spoke up, and when Juliet had heard of the "surprising
adventures," she was sorry she had been the least bit cross with the
kind-hearted little fellows. To make up for it, she gave the kitten a
saucer of warm milk, and taking off the soiled clothes of the boys, and
washing their faces and hands, she put two funny little night-gowns upon
them, and popped them into her bed, which was in a little room next to
the laundry. Then she caught up their clothes&mdash;for there was no time to
be lost&mdash;and popped <i>them</i> into a tub of hot water, with plenty of soap,
and in ten minutes they were just as clean as soap, water, and hard
rubbing could make them.</p>

<p>Then she wrung them out with a will, shook them out with a flourish, and
running into the steam-room, hung them upon a horse&mdash;a clothes-horse, of
course. In ten minutes more they were dry enough to iron, and she
polished them with the hot and heavy irons at such a rate that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span> they
fairly shone, and she shone too.</p>

<p>When the boys were called, and Juliet put on their clothes again, they
looked cleaner, brighter, and happier than ever.</p>

<p>The kitten was adopted as a friend too, and had soon shook and licked
itself clean, and it lived a very comfortable life down in the laundry.</p>

<p>One day, for a wonder, Charley's mother staid at home. She was expecting
a call from her lawyer, Judge Spencer, upon some business. When he came
he had a long talk with Charley.</p>

<p>Presently Charley said: "I want to tell you something. I've a friend;
his name is George."</p>

<p>"Only one friend?" asked the Judge, laughing.</p>

<p>"But he's my 'tic'lar friend," explained Charley. "May I bring him to
see you? He's real nice."</p>

<p>"Does he live in the hotel?" asked Charley's mother, who had never heard
of him.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," replied Charley, "and he and I have a <i>love-aly</i> kitten&mdash;we
take care of it."</p>

<p>"Well, bring him in&mdash;the kitten too," said the good Judge; "that is, if
your mother consents."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly," said Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>So Charley rushed down the narrow stairs, and found George playing with
the kitten, and looking as neat and clean as a new pin.</p>

<p>"Come, George, come up with me to mamma's parlor. Judge Spencer is
there; he wants to see you, and the kitten too."</p>

<p>They went up stairs, and softly opening the door of the parlor, and
holding George's hand tightly, Charley walked quickly up to the Judge
and said, "Here's my friend; he can't help being black!"</p>

<p>For one moment astonishment kept Charley's mamma and the Judge silent.
Then the good man held out his hand to the black boy, and taking Charley
on his knee kissed him tenderly. That warm, loving kiss told Charley
that the Judge understood it all. His face grew radiant, his eyes rested
affectionately on his friend, and then he leaned toward George, and put
the beloved kitten in his arms. "You hold it now," he said.</p>

<p>With a cautionary wave of his hand, the Judge prevented Mrs. Lee from
reproving Charley for his choice of a friend; then he sent them into the
next room, and had a long talk with the widow, the result of which was
that, after inquiring about George, and finding how good his "raisin'"
was, as Juliet called it, Charley was still permitted to play with him.

<span style="margin-left: 27em;">There was once a wee boy</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 27em;">But when the long service</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 24em;">And then she would stop on her way from the pew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24em;">And propound a conundrum, which he never knew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 27em;">For she asked him the "drift of the sermon."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 27em;">By-and-by, when the little boy's</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 27em;">The whole world an unanswered</span><br />

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am ten years old. I like to read <span class="smcap">Young People</span>. The Post-office
Box letters are nice. Katie R.&nbsp;P. says she collects insects. So
does my papa. He puts lumps of cyanide of potassium, bought at the
druggist's, in a bottle, and mixes plaster of Paris with water
until it is like dough, and then pours it over the potassium. When
it dries, the bottle is ready for use. Five cents' worth lasts a
season, and is cheaper than ether, papa says, and works better.
When the butterflies are dead, he spreads them on a board to dry,
spreading their wings carefully and evenly, and holding them in
place with pins. Papa has butterflies all the way from China. He
has as many as five hundred kinds. He raises them just as people
do chickens, right from the egg. He calls the worms his
pets&mdash;great green ones. I get food for them. They eat lots. He
calls worms larv&aelig;, which he says means baby butterflies.</p>

<p>That butterfly Bessie F. had was the Danais, papa thinks.
Butterflies are all foreigners, and have queer names I don't
understand. The worm of the Danais is found on milkweed, papa
tells me. It does not spin a cocoon, but forms a chrysalis&mdash;a
handsome green sack that looks like an ear-drop, with gold and
black spots on it.</p></div>

<p>It is scarcely safe to recommend the handling of cyanide of potassium,

terrible of poisons, and works much mischief and suffering by merely
coming in contact with a slight cut on the finger.</p>

<p><b>A Good Samaritan who would not tell his Name.</b>&mdash;Oberlin, the well-known
philanthropist of Steinthal, while yet a candidate for the ministry, was
travelling on one occasion from Strasburg. It was in the winter-time.
The ground was deeply covered with snow, and the roads were almost
impassable. He had reached the middle of his journey, and was among the
mountains, but by that time was so exhausted that he could stand up no
longer. He was rapidly freezing to death. Sleep began to overcome him;
all power to resist it left him. He commended himself to God, and
yielded to what he felt to be the sleep of death. He knew not how long
he slept, but suddenly became conscious of some one rousing him and
waking him up. Before him stood a wagon-driver in his blue blouse, the
wagon being not far away. He gave him a little wine and food, and warmth
returned. He then helped him into the wagon, and brought him to the next
village. The rescued man was profuse in his thanks, and offered money,
which his benefactor refused. "It is only a duty to help one another,"
said the wagoner, "and it is the next thing to an insult to offer a
reward for such a service." "Then," replied Oberlin, "at least tell me
your name, that I may have you in thankful remembrance before God." "I
see," said the wagoner, "that you are a minister of the Gospel: please
tell me the name of the Good Samaritan." "That," said Oberlin, "I can
not do, for it was not put on record." "Then," replied the wagoner,
"until you can tell me his name, permit me to withhold mine." Soon he
had driven out of sight, and Oberlin never saw him again.</p>

<p><b>Earthquakes in Chili.</b>&mdash;In some parts of South America men keep their
"earthquake coats," which are dresses that can be put on
instantaneously, with a view to a speedy exit from the house. The
advisability of such a practice may be inferred from the picture of one
of the features of life in Chili which is set forth in the following
extract from a letter of a young Englishman, who settled at Valparaiso a
few years ago. Under date of November 16 he writes: "I am in a most
nervous state on account of having had three days and nights of
successive earthquakes&mdash;fearful ones. The first night I walked the
streets, and indeed every one else did the same; the second night I went
to bed quite exhausted at about 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>; last night also at about 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>,
but I could not sleep, for we had about six shocks, though not so
strong. The whole cornice of a house close to ours came down into the
street, but luckily no one was passing at the time. The women rush into
the street in their night dresses, screaming like lunatics, and one
trembles from head to foot. I was crossing our street when the strongest
shock came, and I was transfixed with fright, for the road was going up
and down like waves. My hand even now shakes, for at any moment we may
have another, and how strong it may be no one can tell. I can assure you
I am afraid to take off my clothes. The large squares have been filled
for the last three nights with beds and people wrapped up in blankets."</p>
